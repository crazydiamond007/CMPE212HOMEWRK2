In the context of C++, the term "merge" typically refers to combining two or more sorted sequences into a single sorted sequence. It is a common operation in algorithms and data structures, particularly when working with arrays or containers.

The merge operation involves taking two sorted sequences and merging them into a new sequence in a way that maintains the sorted order. This is often used in sorting algorithms such as merge sort and in other operations that require combining and sorting two sorted sets of data.

The standard library in C++ provides a convenient function called std::merge that can be used to merge two sorted sequences. Here's a simple example:
